# Erdős Problem 70

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/70](https://www.erdosproblems.com/70)

## Problem Statement

Let 𝔠 be the cardinality of the continuum (i.e. `2 ^ ℵ₀`), let β be any countable ordinal,
and let `2 ≤ n < ω`. Is it true that 𝔠 → (β, n)³₂?

Here the notation 𝔠 → (β, n)³₂ means: for any 2-coloring (red/blue) of all 3-element subsets
of a well-ordered set of order type 𝔠.ord (the smallest ordinal of cardinality 𝔠), either:
- there exists a *red-monochromatic* subset of order type β (every 3-element subset is red), or
- there exists a *blue-monochromatic* subset of cardinality n (every 3-element subset is blue).

This is the 3-uniform (triple) partition relation, as opposed to the 2-uniform (pair/graph)
partition relation `𝔠 → (β, n)²₂` studied in Problems 590–592.

## Known Results

- **Erdős–Rado**: 𝔠 → (ω + n, 4)³₂ for any `2 ≤ n < ω`. In particular, the relation
  𝔠 → (ω + n, 4)³₂ holds for all finite n ≥ 2 (proved; see `erdos_70.variants.erdos_rado`).

## Status

**OPEN**: The general question (arbitrary countable β, finite n ≥ 2) is open.

## Definitions

We introduce `OrdinalCardinalRamsey3 α β c` for the 3-uniform analogue of
`OrdinalCardinalRamsey α β c`: a 2-coloring of 3-element subsets of the ordinal type α
yields either a red set of order type β or a blue set of cardinality c.

/- ### The 3-uniform partition relation -/

/--
`OrdinalCardinalRamsey3 α β c` asserts the 3-uniform ordinal Ramsey property `α → (β, c)³₂`.

It states that for any 2-coloring of all 3-element subsets of (the ordinal type) `α`,
one of the following must hold:
* There is a red-monochromatic subset of order type β: every 3-element sub-subset is colored
  red. (Formally: a set `s ⊆ α.ToType` with `typeLT s = β` such that any three distinct
  elements of `s` are colored red.)
* There is a blue-monochromatic subset of cardinality `c`: a set `s ⊆ α.ToType` with `#s = c`
  such that every three distinct elements of `s` are colored blue.

The coloring is given as a function `col : α.ToType → α.ToType → α.ToType → Bool`
(or equivalently, a predicate `isRed : α.ToType → α.ToType → α.ToType → Prop`) on
unordered triples; we represent it symmetrically via `Set.Triplewise`.

The ordinal of the continuum: the smallest ordinal whose cardinality equals the continuum `𝔠`.
This is `Cardinal.continuum.ord` in Mathlib notation.

Erdős writes "𝔠" for the *ordinal type* of the reals; formally (under AC) this is any ordinal
whose underlying set has cardinality `2 ^ ℵ₀`. The canonical choice is `𝔠.ord`.

/- ### The main open problem -/

/--
**Erdős Problem 70** (Open): Let 𝔠 be the cardinality of the continuum, let β be a countable
ordinal, and let `2 ≤ n < ω`. Is it true that 𝔠 → (β, n)³₂?

Formally: for any countable ordinal β and any natural number n ≥ 2, does
`OrdinalCardinalRamsey3 𝔠.ord β n` hold?

Here:
- `𝔠.ord = Cardinal.continuum.ord` is the least ordinal of cardinality the continuum.
- `β` ranges over countable ordinals (i.e. `β.card ≤ ℵ₀`).
- `n : ℕ` satisfies `2 ≤ n`.
- `OrdinalCardinalRamsey3 α β c` is the 3-uniform partition relation `α → (β, c)³₂`.

/--
**Erdős–Rado partial result**: 𝔠 → (ω + n, 4)³₂ for any `2 ≤ n < ω`.

Erdős and Rado proved that any 2-coloring of 3-element subsets of a set of cardinality 𝔠
contains either a red-monochromatic subset of order type ω + n (for any fixed finite n ≥ 2),
or a blue-monochromatic set of cardinality 4.

This gives a positive partial answer to Problem 70 with β = ω + n and the blue side fixed at 4.

**Status**: TRUE (Erdős–Rado).

**Special case**: 𝔠 → (ω, 3)³₂.

The simplest non-trivial instance of Erdős Problem 70: β = ω (the first infinite countable
ordinal) and n = 3. Does every 2-coloring of 3-element subsets of the continuum contain
either a red-monochromatic set of order type ω (an infinite red-monochromatic subset) or a
blue-monochromatic set of 3 elements (a blue triple)?

**Status**: OPEN (follows from the main conjecture with β = ω, n = 3).

**The relation at ω₁**: 𝔠 → (ω₁, n)³₂ for finite n ≥ 2, where ω₁ = ℵ₁ is the first
uncountable ordinal.

Note that ω₁ is *not* a countable ordinal, so this is not directly an instance of the
main Erdős problem (which asks for *countable* β). However, it is a closely related question.
Under the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), ω₁ = 𝔠.ord, making this a self-referential question
about 𝔠.ord → (𝔠.ord, n)³₂.

**Status**: OPEN.

**Monotonicity of `OrdinalCardinalRamsey3`** (proved):
If `OrdinalCardinalRamsey3 α β c` holds and `β' ≤ β`, `c' ≤ c`, then
`OrdinalCardinalRamsey3 α β' c'` also holds.

This allows us to deduce weaker partition results from stronger ones.
