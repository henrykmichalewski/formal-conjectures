# Erdős Problem 501

**Verbatim statement (Erdős #501, status O):**
> For every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ let $A_x\subset \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded set with outer measure $<1$. Must there exist an infinite independent set, that is, some infinite $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $x\not\in A_y$ for all $x\neq y\in X$?If the sets $A_x$ are closed and have measure $<1$, then must there exist an independent set of size $3$?

/- ## Setup

For every `x : ℝ` we are given a set `A x ⊆ ℝ`. We say that `X ⊆ ℝ` is an
**independent set** for the family `A` if `x ∉ A y` for all distinct `x y ∈ X`.
This captures the combinatorial independence relation: `x` does not belong to the
set "assigned to" `y`.

The problem concerns outer measure `< 1` on ℝ. For a set `s : Set ℝ` we use
`(MeasureTheory.volume.toOuterMeasure) s`, which equals the Lebesgue outer measure
of `s` (defined for all sets, whether measurable or not). The condition `< 1` is
stated in `ℝ≥0∞` (extended non-negative reals). -/

/-- `X ⊆ ℝ` is an **independent set** for the family `A : ℝ → Set ℝ` if
`x ∉ A y` for all distinct `x y ∈ X`. -/
def IsIndependent (A : ℝ → Set ℝ) (X : Set ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ x ∈ X, ∀ y ∈ X, x ≠ y → x ∉ A y

/- ## Main open problem -/

/--
For every `x ∈ ℝ` let `A x ⊆ ℝ` be a bounded set with (Lebesgue) outer measure `< 1`.
Must there exist an infinite independent set, that is, some infinite `X ⊆ ℝ` such
that `x ∉ A y` for all `x ≠ y` in `X`?

This is **open** in full generality (as of 2025).

Known results:
- Erdős and Hajnal [ErHa60] proved the existence of arbitrarily large finite
  independent sets.
- Hechler [He72] showed the answer is **no** assuming the continuum hypothesis (CH).

**Erdős–Hajnal (1960): arbitrarily large finite independent sets exist.**

For every `n : ℕ` and every family `A : ℝ → Set ℝ` of bounded sets with Lebesgue
outer measure `< 1`, there exists a finite independent set of size at least `n`.

This was proved by Erdős and Hajnal [ErHa60]. -/

**Hechler (1972): the answer to the main question is NO, assuming the continuum hypothesis.**

Assuming CH (`ℵ₁ = 𝔠`), there exists a family `A : ℝ → Set ℝ` of bounded sets with
Lebesgue outer measure `< 1` for which no infinite independent set exists.

**Closed sets case: existence of an independent set of size 3.**

If the sets `A x` are closed with Lebesgue measure `< 1`, must there exist an
independent set of size 3?

This is implied by the stronger theorem of Newelski–Pawlikowski–Seredyński below.

[Gl62] Gladysz proved the existence of an independent set of size 2 in this case. -/

**Newelski–Pawlikowski–Seredyński (1987): infinite independent set in the closed case.**

If all the sets `A x` are closed with Lebesgue measure `< 1`, then there **is** an
infinite independent set. This gives a strong affirmative answer to the second
question of Problem 501.

**Gladysz (1962): independent set of size 2 in the closed case.**

If all the sets `A x` are closed with Lebesgue measure `< 1`, then there exist two
distinct reals `x y` such that `x ∉ A y` and `y ∉ A x`.

This is a weaker result proved by Gladysz [Gl62] before the full Newelski–Pawlikowski–
Seredyński theorem.

/- ## Sanity checks and examples

The following `example` declarations exercise the proved variants and demonstrate that
the hypotheses of the main theorem are non-vacuous. All goals are fully closed: no `sorry`. -/

/-- The constant family `A x = ∅` satisfies all hypotheses of the main problem:
each `A x` is bounded (the empty set is bounded) and has Lebesgue outer measure 0 < 1.
Moreover, all of ℝ is an independent set, showing the conclusion holds trivially.

This demonstrates that the hypotheses are non-vacuous: the family `A x = ∅` is a valid
input to the theorem, and `ℝ` (which is infinite) witnesses the conclusion. -/
@[category test, AMS 5]
example :
    let A : ℝ → Set ℝ := fun _ => ∅
    (∀ x, Bornology.IsBounded (A x)) ∧
    (∀ x, volume.toOuterMeasure (A x) < 1) ∧
    ∃ X : Set ℝ, X.Infinite ∧ IsIndependent A X := by
  refine ⟨fun _ => Bornology.isBounded_empty, fun _ => ?_, Set.univ, Set.infinite_univ, ?_⟩
  · simp
  · intro x _ y _ _ hxAy; exact hxAy

/-- A singleton `{0}` is an independent set for any family `A : ℝ → Set ℝ`,
as witnessed by `erdos_501.variants.singleton_independent`. -/
@[category test, AMS 5]
example (A : ℝ → Set ℝ) : IsIndependent A {0} :=
  erdos_501.variants.singleton_independent A 0

/-- Two reals form an independent set for the empty family `A _ = ∅`:
neither 0 nor 1 belongs to ∅, so both conditions of `pair_independent_iff` hold. -/
@[category test, AMS 5]
example : IsIndependent (fun _ => (∅ : Set ℝ)) {0, 1} := by
  rw [erdos_501.variants.pair_independent_iff _ (by norm_num : (0:ℝ) ≠ 1)]
  exact ⟨Set.notMem_empty _, Set.notMem_empty _⟩

/-- The hypothesis `volume.toOuterMeasure (A x) < 1` is strictly satisfied when
`A x = {x}` (a singleton), since Lebesgue measure of a singleton is 0. -/
@[category test, AMS 5]
example (x : ℝ) : volume.toOuterMeasure ({x} : Set ℝ) < 1 := by
  simp [Measure.toOuterMeasure_apply]

/-- The boundary case: the measure condition `< 1` is sharp. An interval of length ≥ 1
has Lebesgue measure ≥ 1, so it would fail the hypothesis. Here `[0, 1]` has measure exactly 1. -/
@[category test, AMS 5]
example : volume.toOuterMeasure (Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1) = 1 := by
  simp [Measure.toOuterMeasure_apply, Real.volume_Icc]
