WOWII [Conjecture 63](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`,
`f(G) ≥ ⌈(min_v distEven(v) + b(G) + 1) / 3⌉`
where `f(G) = largestInducedForestSize G` is the size of a largest induced forest,
`b(G)` is the largest induced bipartite subgraph size, and
`distEven(v)` is the number of vertices at even distance from `v`.
