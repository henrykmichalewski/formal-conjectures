WOWII [Conjecture 143](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`,
`tree(G) ≥ (girth(G) + 1) / σ(G)`
where `tree(G)` is the largest induced tree size, `girth(G)` is the length of
the shortest cycle, and `σ(G) = twoDominationNumber G` is the 2-domination
number of `G`.  We use real-number division; when `σ(G) = 0` the right-hand
side is interpreted as `+∞`, which is vacuously true.
