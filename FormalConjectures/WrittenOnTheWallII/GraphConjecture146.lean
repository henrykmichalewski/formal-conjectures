# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 146

## Definitions

The **square** of a graph `G`, denoted `G²`, is the graph on the same vertex set where
two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance in `G` is at most 2.

The **radius of G²** is the minimum eccentricity of any vertex in `G²`, i.e.,
  `rad(G²) = min_{v ∈ V} max_{u ∈ V} dist_{G²}(u, v)`.

WOWII [Conjecture 146](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`,
`tree(G) ≥ 2 * ecc(B) / rad(G²)`
where `tree(G)` is the number of vertices in a largest induced subtree,
`ecc(B)` is the eccentricity of the boundary vertices of `G`, and
`rad(G²)` is the radius of the square graph of `G`.

We state the inequality in the form `tree(G) * rad(G²) ≥ 2 * ecc(B)` to avoid division.
