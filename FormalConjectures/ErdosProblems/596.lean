## Overview

**Problem (Erdős–Hajnal, [Er87])**: For which graphs $G_1, G_2$ is it true that
1. for every $n \geq 1$ there is a graph $H$ without a $G_1$ but if the edges of $H$ are
   $n$-coloured then there is a monochromatic copy of $G_2$ (the **finite Ramsey property**),
   and yet
2. for every graph $H$ without a $G_1$ there is an $\aleph_0$-colouring of the edges of $H$
   without a monochromatic $G_2$ (the **countable Ramsey escape property**)?

Erdős and Hajnal originally conjectured that no such pair $(G_1, G_2)$ exists. However,
$G_1 = C_4$ and $G_2 = C_6$ is an example: Nešetřil and Rödl [NeRo75] established the first
property, and Erdős and Hajnal established the second (in fact every $C_4$-free graph is a
countable union of trees, and trees are $C_6$-free).

Whether this is true for $G_1 = K_4$ and $G_2 = K_3$ is the content of Problem [595].

## Formalization note

We formalize the two key properties for a pair of graphs $(G_1, G_2)$ (with `Type`-valued
vertex types to avoid universe metavariable issues):

- **Finite Ramsey property** (`HasFiniteRamseyProperty`): For every `n : ℕ` with `1 ≤ n`,
  there exists a $G_1$-free graph `H` such that every `n`-edge-colouring of `H` contains a
  monochromatic copy of $G_2$. We encode "$G_1$-free" via `SimpleGraph.Copy` (absence of an
  injective graph homomorphism from $G_1$) and an `n`-edge-colouring as a family
  `c : Fin n → SimpleGraph V` of colour-class subgraphs whose union is `H`.

- **Countable Ramsey escape** (`HasCountableRamseyEscape`): Every $G_1$-free graph `H` has a
  countable edge-colouring (a family `d : ℕ → SimpleGraph W` with union `H`) in which every
  colour class is $G_2$-free.

A pair $(G_1, G_2)$ is called **Erdős–Hajnal exceptional** (`IsErdosHajnalExceptional`) if it
has both properties simultaneously.

**Erdős Problem 596**: For which graphs $G_1, G_2$ is it true that
(1) for every $n \geq 1$ there is a graph $H$ without a $G_1$ but if the edges of $H$ are
    $n$-coloured then there is a monochromatic copy of $G_2$, and yet
(2) for every graph $H$ without a $G_1$ there is an $\aleph_0$-colouring of the edges of $H$
    without a monochromatic $G_2$?

A problem of Erdős and Hajnal [Er87].

Erdős and Hajnal originally conjectured that no such pair $(G_1, G_2)$ exists, but
$(C_4, C_6)$ is an example: Nešetřil and Rödl [NeRo75] established the first property and
Erdős and Hajnal established the second. The problem is to characterize **all** such pairs.

See Problem [595] for the specific question of whether $(K_4, K_3)$ is such a pair.

**Formalization:** We formalize the problem as asking for a complete characterization of all
Erdős–Hajnal exceptional pairs. The `answer(sorry)` reflects that such a characterization is
open: we do not know which pairs $(G_1, G_2)$ have both properties simultaneously.

**Status:** OPEN.

**The countable Ramsey escape holds for $(C_4, C_6)$**: Every $C_4$-free graph is a countable
union of trees (Erdős and Hajnal [Er87]). Trees are acyclic, hence $C_6$-free, giving the
countable Ramsey escape for $(C_4, C_6)$.

**Connection to Problem 595**: Whether $(K_4, K_3)$ is Erdős–Hajnal exceptional is precisely
the content of Erdős Problem 595. The finite Ramsey property holds (Folkman [1970],
Nešetřil–Rödl [NeRo75]). The open part is whether every $K_4$-free graph is a countable
union of triangle-free graphs, which is exactly the countable Ramsey escape for $(K_4, K_3)$.

**Status:** OPEN (= Problem 595).
