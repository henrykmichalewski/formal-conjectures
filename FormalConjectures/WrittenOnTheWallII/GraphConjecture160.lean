# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 160

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

## Definitions

For a vertex `v` in `G`, **T(v)** is the number of triangles incident to `v`:
  `T(v) = |{u, w} ⊆ N(v) | u ~ w|`
i.e., the number of pairs of neighbors of `v` that are themselves adjacent.

The invariant `maxTrianglesAtVertex G` is the maximum of T(v) over all vertices.

**Conjecture 160** uses both `max T(v)` and `c_C4(G)` (the number of induced 4-cycles,
already defined in GraphConjecture133) to bound the largest induced forest size `Ls(G)`.

WOWII [Conjecture 160](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`,
`Ls(G) ≥ max_v l(v) + max_v T(v) * c_C4(G)`
where:
- `Ls(G)` is the size of a largest induced forest,
- `max_v l(v)` is the maximum local independence number over vertices,
- `max_v T(v)` is the maximum number of triangles incident to any vertex,
- `c_C4(G)` is the number of induced 4-cycles in `G`.
