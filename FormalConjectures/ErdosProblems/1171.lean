# Erdős Problem 1171

## Problem Statement

Is it true that, for all finite $k$ (with $k < \omega$),
$$\omega_1^2 \to (\omega_1 \cdot \omega, \underbrace{3, \ldots, 3}_{k})^2_{k+1}?$$

This is a multicolor generalization of the Erdős–Hajnal theorem. It asks whether every
$(k+1)$-coloring of the pairs (edges) of the complete graph on $\omega_1^2$ either:
- produces a monochromatic set of order type $\omega_1 \cdot \omega$ in color 0, or
- produces a monochromatic triangle $K_3$ in some non-zero color $i \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$.

## Known Results

- **Erdős–Hajnal** [EH74]: $\omega_1^2 \to (\omega_1 \cdot \omega, 3)^2$ (the $k = 1$ case).
  This is the binary partition relation with one "large" color and one "triangle" color.
- **Baumgartner** [Ba89b]: Under a form of Martin's axiom (MA), the binary relation
  $\omega_1 \cdot \omega \to (\omega_1 \cdot \omega, 3)^2$ holds.

## Overview

The key novelty here is `OrdinalMultiColorRamsey`: a $(k+1)$-color generalization of the
binary ordinal Ramsey relation. In `OrdinalMultiColorRamsey α β γ k`:
- `α` is the ordinal whose pairs are colored (the vertex set),
- `β` is the ordinal type required for a color-0 clique,
- `γ` is the clique size (as a cardinal) required for each non-zero color,
- `k` is the number of non-zero colors (so there are `k+1` colors total).

The open question `erdos_1171` asks whether this holds for all finite `k` with
`α = ω₁²`, `β = ω₁ · ω`, `γ = 3`.

/- ### The multicolor ordinal partition relation -/

/--
`OrdinalMultiColorRamsey α β γ k` asserts the multicolor partition relation
`α → (β, γ, γ, …, γ)²_{k+1}` (with `k` copies of `γ`).

It states: for any function `col : Sym2 α.ToType → Fin (k + 1)` assigning one of `k+1` colors
to each pair from `α`, one of the following holds:
* Color 0: there is a set `s ⊆ α.ToType` of order type `β` that is monochromatic in color 0
  (i.e. every pair in `s` gets color 0), or
* Color i (for some `i : Fin k`): there is a set `s ⊆ α.ToType` with `#s = γ` that is
  monochromatic in color `i.succ` (i.e. every pair in `s` gets color `i.succ`).

When `k = 1` this reduces to the binary partition relation `α → (β, γ)²`.

/- ### The main open problem -/

/--
**OPEN**: Is it true that for all finite $k < \omega$,
$$\omega_1^2 \to (\omega_1 \cdot \omega, \underbrace{3, \ldots, 3}_{k})^2_{k+1}?$$

In any $(k+1)$-coloring of the pairs of the complete graph on $\omega_1^2$, either:
* there is a color-0 set of order type $\omega_1 \cdot \omega$, or
* there is a monochromatic triangle $K_3$ in some non-zero color.

The case $k = 1$ (binary, `erdos_1171.variants.k_one`) is the Erdős–Hajnal theorem.

**Status**: OPEN.

/- ### Variants and known results -/

namespace erdos_1171.variants

/--
**Erdős–Hajnal theorem**: The case $k = 1$.

$\omega_1^2 \to (\omega_1 \cdot \omega, 3)^2$: in any 2-coloring of the pairs of $K_{\omega_1^2}$,
there is either a color-0 set of order type $\omega_1 \cdot \omega$, or a color-1 triangle.

This is the binary Ramsey relation `OrdinalRamsey (ω_ 1 ^ 2) (ω_ 1 * ω) 3`, which can be
seen as the $k = 1$ instance of `OrdinalMultiColorRamsey (ω_ 1 ^ 2) (ω_ 1 * ω) 3 1`.

**Status**: Proved (Erdős–Hajnal [EH74]).

  sorry

/--
**Reduction**: `OrdinalMultiColorRamsey` is monotone in the number of non-zero colors.

If the `k`-color version `OrdinalMultiColorRamsey α β γ k` holds, then the `j`-color version
holds for all `j ≤ k`. A `j+1`-coloring can be embedded into a `k+1`-coloring by composing
with the inclusion `Fin (j+1) ↪ Fin (k+1)`, so a witness for the `k`-color version
provides a witness for the `j`-color version.

/- **Baumgartner under MA (currently deferred)**: Assuming a form of Martin's Axiom,
the binary partition relation `ω₁·ω → (ω₁·ω, 3)²` holds [Ba89b]. We omit the Lean
statement for now because faithfully encoding the exact form of MA requires more work;
stating the result as `True → ...` would effectively make it unconditional. To be
restored once an appropriate MA predicate is available in the formalization. -/
