WOWII [Conjecture 142](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`,
`tree(G) ≥ (2/3) · girth(G) + ecc(B)`
where `tree(G)` is the largest induced tree size, `girth(G)` is the length of
the shortest cycle (0 if acyclic), `B = maxEccentricityVertices G` is the set
of vertices with maximum eccentricity (the "boundary"), and `ecc(B)` is the
eccentricity of the set `B` — defined as the maximum distance from any vertex
outside `B` to `B`.
