# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 145

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

## Definitions

The **local independence minimum** `lMin(G)` is:
  `lMin(G) = min_{v ∈ V(G)} l(v)`
where `l(v) = indepNeighborsCard(G, v)` is the independence number of the neighbourhood of `v`.
This is the minimum over all vertices of the local independence number.

The **boundary vertices** `B(G)` of a connected graph are the vertices `v` such that
the eccentricity of `v` equals the diameter of `G`.

The **eccentricity of a set** `ecc(S)` = max over all vertices `u ∉ S` of the minimum
distance from `u` to any vertex in `S`.  In the conjecture below, `ecc(B)` is the
eccentricity of the boundary set.

**Note on Conjecture 145:** The statement is
  `tree(G) ≥ 2 * ecc(B) / λ_min(Ḡ)`
where `tree(G)` is `largestInducedTreeSize G`, `ecc(B)` is the eccentricity of the
boundary vertices, and `λ_min(Ḡ)` is the local independence minimum of the complement `Ḡ`.

WOWII [Conjecture 145](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`,
`tree(G) ≥ 2 * ecc(B) / λ_min(Ḡ)`
where `tree(G)` is the number of vertices in a largest induced subtree,
`ecc(B)` is the eccentricity of the boundary vertices, and
`λ_min(Ḡ)` is the minimum local independence number of the complement graph.

We state the inequality in the form `tree(G) * lMin(Ḡ) ≥ 2 * ecc(B)` to avoid division.
