# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 133

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

## Definitions

`cC4 G` counts the number of **induced** 4-cycles in `G`.  We define this by
counting unordered 4-tuples `{a, b, c, d}` of distinct vertices (with a fixed
ordering to avoid overcounting) such that the induced subgraph on them is
isomorphic to the cycle `C₄`, i.e. the induced graph has exactly 4 edges
arranged as a 4-cycle.  Concretely, we check that the edge set of
`G.induce {a, b, c, d}` has exactly the 4 edges of some cyclic ordering.

We test all three perfect-matching pairings of the four vertices to find
a cyclic ordering and verify that the induced subgraph has exactly those 4 edges. -/

/-- Count of induced C₄ subgraphs of `G`. We count ordered 4-tuples `(a,b,c,d)`
of distinct vertices such that `a-b-c-d-a` is an induced 4-cycle, then divide
by 8 (each unordered cycle gives 8 oriented tuples: 4 rotations × 2 reflections).
For simplicity we use the ordered-tuple count directly as the invariant. -/

WOWII [Conjecture 133](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`,
`path(G) ≥ rad(G) + ⌊avg_v l(v)⌋ ^ cC4(G)`
where `path(G)` is the floor of the average distance, `rad(G)` is the radius
(minimum eccentricity, as a natural number), `avg_v l(v) = l G` is the average
independence number of vertex neighbourhoods, and `cC4(G)` is the number of
induced C₄ subgraphs.
