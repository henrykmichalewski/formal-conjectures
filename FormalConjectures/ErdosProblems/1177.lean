# Erdős Problem 1177

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1177](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1177)

*References:*
- [EGH75] Erdős, Paul and Galvin, Fred and Hajnal, András, On set-systems having large
  chromatic number and not containing prescribed subsystems.
  Infinite and finite sets (Colloq., Keszthely, 1973; dedicated to P. Erdős on his 60th
  birthday), Vol. I. Colloq. Math. Soc. János Bolyai 10, North-Holland (1975), 425–513.

**Problem (Erdős, Galvin, Hajnal)**: Let $G$ be a finite 3-uniform hypergraph, and let
$\mathcal{F}_G(\kappa)$ denote the collection of 3-uniform hypergraphs with chromatic number
$\kappa$ not containing $G$ as a sub-hypergraph. Three conjectures:

1. If $\mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1)$ is non-empty then there exists
   $X \in \mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1)$ with $|X| \leq 2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$.

2. If both $\mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1)$ and $\mathcal{F}_H(\aleph_1)$ are non-empty then
   $\mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1) \cap \mathcal{F}_H(\aleph_1)$ is non-empty.

3. If $\kappa, \lambda$ are uncountable cardinals and $\mathcal{F}_G(\kappa)$ is non-empty
   then $\mathcal{F}_G(\lambda)$ is non-empty.

**Status:** OPEN (all three conjectures).

**Formalization notes:**
- A 3-uniform hypergraph on vertex type `V` is a pair `(edges, uniform)` where
  `edges : Set (Finset V)` and every edge has cardinality 3. This follows the same
  representation used in Problem 593 (`Erdos593.ThreeUniformHypergraph`).
- A proper coloring sends vertices to colors so that no hyperedge is monochromatic.
  The chromatic cardinal is the infimum of cardinalities of color types admitting a proper
  coloring.
- `FamilyAvoids G κ` is the set of pairs `⟨V, H⟩` (with `V : Type`) such that `H` has
  chromatic cardinal exactly `κ` and does not contain `G` as a sub-hypergraph.
  This formalizes $\mathcal{F}_G(\kappa)$.
- All `DecidableEq` instances are supplied automatically via `Classical` in this file.

/- ## Definitions for 3-uniform hypergraphs

These definitions mirror those in Problem 593 (`Erdos593`); they are reproduced here so
that this file is self-contained. -/

/-- A **3-uniform hypergraph** on vertex type `V` is a set of 3-element `Finset`s.
Each element of `edges` is a hyperedge, and `uniform` ensures each has exactly 3 vertices.
This definition mirrors `Erdos593.ThreeUniformHypergraph`. -/
structure ThreeUniformHypergraph (V : Type) where
  /-- The set of hyperedges: each edge is a 3-element finset of vertices. -/
  edges : Set (Finset V)
  /-- Every hyperedge has exactly 3 vertices. -/
  uniform : ∀ e ∈ edges, e.card = 3

/-- A **proper coloring** of a 3-uniform hypergraph `H` by a color type `C` is a vertex
coloring such that no hyperedge is monochromatic (all three vertices receive the same color). -/
def ThreeUniformHypergraph.IsProperColoring {V : Type} (H : ThreeUniformHypergraph V)
    {C : Type} (f : V → C) : Prop :=
  ∀ e ∈ H.edges, ∃ u ∈ e, ∃ v ∈ e, f u ≠ f v

/-- The **chromatic cardinal** of a 3-uniform hypergraph `H` is the infimum of cardinalities
of color types admitting a proper coloring. -/
noncomputable def ThreeUniformHypergraph.chromaticCardinal {V : Type}
    (H : ThreeUniformHypergraph V) : Cardinal.{0} :=
  sInf {κ : Cardinal.{0} | ∃ (C : Type), #C = κ ∧ ∃ f : V → C, H.IsProperColoring f}

/-- A 3-uniform hypergraph `F` **appears** in `H` (as a sub-hypergraph) if there exists an
injective vertex map `φ : W → V` that sends every hyperedge of `F` to a hyperedge of `H`.
We use `Classical.decEq` to provide `DecidableEq V` for `Finset.image`. -/
def ThreeUniformHypergraph.Appears {W V : Type} (F : ThreeUniformHypergraph W)
    (H : ThreeUniformHypergraph V) : Prop :=
  ∃ φ : W → V, Function.Injective φ ∧
    ∀ e ∈ F.edges, (e.image φ) ∈ H.edges

/- ## The family F_G(κ) -/

/-- `FamilyAvoids G κ` is the set of pairs `⟨V, H⟩` where `V : Type`,
`H : ThreeUniformHypergraph V`, `H.chromaticCardinal = κ`, and `G` does not appear in `H`.

This formalizes $\mathcal{F}_G(\kappa)$ from the problem statement. -/
def FamilyAvoids {W : Type} (G : ThreeUniformHypergraph W)
    (κ : Cardinal.{0}) : Set (Σ V : Type, ThreeUniformHypergraph V) :=
  {p | p.2.chromaticCardinal = κ ∧ ¬ G.Appears p.2}

/- ## Main conjectures -/

/--
**Erdős–Galvin–Hajnal Problem 1177, Conjecture 1**: If $\mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1)$ is non-empty
then there exists $X \in \mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1)$ of cardinality at most $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$.

More precisely: if there exists a 3-uniform hypergraph with chromatic cardinal $\aleph_1$ not
containing $G$, then there is such a hypergraph whose vertex set has cardinality at most
$2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$.

*Original statement (erdosproblems.com/1177)*:
"If $\mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1)$ is non-empty then there exists $X \in \mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1)$
of cardinality at most $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$."

**Status:** OPEN.

**Erdős–Galvin–Hajnal Problem 1177, Conjecture 2**: If both $\mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1)$ and
$\mathcal{F}_H(\aleph_1)$ are non-empty then $\mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1) \cap \mathcal{F}_H(\aleph_1)$
is non-empty.

More precisely: if there exist 3-uniform hypergraphs with chromatic cardinal $\aleph_1$ avoiding
$G$ and $H$ separately, then there is a single such hypergraph avoiding both simultaneously.

*Original statement (erdosproblems.com/1177)*:
"If both $\mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1)$ and $\mathcal{F}_H(\aleph_1)$ are non-empty then
$\mathcal{F}_G(\aleph_1) \cap \mathcal{F}_H(\aleph_1)$ is non-empty."

**Erdős–Galvin–Hajnal Problem 1177, Conjecture 3**: If $\kappa, \mu$ are uncountable
cardinals and $\mathcal{F}_G(\kappa)$ is non-empty then $\mathcal{F}_G(\mu)$ is non-empty.

More precisely: the property "there exists a 3-uniform hypergraph with chromatic cardinal
$\kappa$ avoiding $G$" depends only on whether $\kappa$ is uncountable, not on the specific
uncountable cardinal chosen.

*Original statement (erdosproblems.com/1177)*:
"If $\kappa, \lambda$ are uncountable cardinals and $\mathcal{F}_G(\kappa)$ is non-empty then
$\mathcal{F}_G(\lambda)$ is non-empty."
(We use $\mu$ in place of $\lambda$ to avoid conflict with Lean 4's reserved `λ` keyword.)

/- ## Variants and sanity checks -/

/--
**The bound in Conjecture 1**: We verify $\aleph_1 \leq 2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$, confirming the
bound in Conjecture 1 is consistent with the chromatic cardinal $\aleph_1$.

The chain is: $\aleph_1 \leq 2^{\aleph_0}$ (by `aleph_one_le_continuum`) and
$2^{\aleph_0} \leq 2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$ (by `Cardinal.power_le_power_right` and `Cardinal.cantor`).

    _ = (2 : Cardinal) ^ ℵ₀ := two_power_aleph0.symm
    _ ≤ (2 : Cardinal) ^ ((2 : Cardinal) ^ ℵ₀) :=
        Cardinal.power_le_power_left (by norm_num) (Cardinal.cantor ℵ₀).le

/--
**Concrete instances for Conjecture 3**: $\aleph_1$ and $\aleph_2$ are both uncountable,
so the pair $(\kappa, \mu) = (\aleph_1, \aleph_2)$ is a concrete non-trivial instance of
the hypothesis of Conjecture 3.

**Transitivity of `Appears`**: if `G₁` appears in `G₂` and `G₂` appears in `H`, then
`G₁` appears in `H`. This is the key composition property underlying Problem 593's
`obligatory_monotone` result.

/--
**Monotonicity of `FamilyAvoids`**: if `G₂` appears in `G₁` (i.e., `G₂` embeds as a
sub-hypergraph into `G₁`) then `FamilyAvoids G₂ κ ⊆ FamilyAvoids G₁ κ`.

Intuition: if `X` avoids `G₂` (a pattern that contains `G₁` via `G₂.Appears G₁`), and
`G₁` were to appear in `X`, then by transitivity (`appears_trans`) `G₂` would appear in `X`,
contradicting the assumption. Hence avoiding the sub-pattern `G₂` is harder: fewer hypergraphs
are in `FamilyAvoids G₂`, and every such hypergraph also avoids the larger `G₁`.
