## Definition

The **crossing number** `cr(G)` of a graph `G` is the minimum number of edge
crossings over all drawings of `G` in the plane (where vertices map to distinct
points and edges to Jordan arcs between their endpoints, with only finitely many
pairwise crossings, each transverse and not at a vertex).

A full geometric formalization of this definition requires substantial topological
infrastructure.  We use a placeholder definition here.

-- TODO: replace `Classical.choice` with a proper topological definition once
-- Mathlib has sufficient support for planar graph drawings (Jordan curves, etc.).

## Conjecture

**Zarankiewicz's conjecture** (1954) — **open**:
  `cr(K_{m,n}) = ⌊m/2⌋ · ⌊(m−1)/2⌋ · ⌊n/2⌋ · ⌊(n−1)/2⌋`.

The formula gives the number of crossings in the standard "cylindrical" drawing
of the complete bipartite graph `K_{m,n}`.  The conjecture is known to hold for
`min(m, n) ≤ 6` but remains open in general.

For the complete bipartite graph `K_{m,n}` (here modeled as the complete
bipartite graph on `Fin m ⊕ Fin n`):
  `cr(K_{m,n}) = ⌊m/2⌋ · ⌊(m−1)/2⌋ · ⌊n/2⌋ · ⌊(n−1)/2⌋`.

For any simple graph `G` with `|E| ≥ 4 |V|`:
  `cr(G) ≥ |E|³ / (64 · |V|²)`.

We state the inequality in terms of `Fintype.card` and `G.edgeFinset.card`. -/
