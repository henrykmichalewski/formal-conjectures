# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 7

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

**Conjecture 7:** For a connected graph `G`,
`Ls(G) ≥ max_v λ(v) - 1 + n - 2 α(G)`,
where `Ls(G)` is the maximum number of leaves over all spanning trees,
`n = |V(G)|`, `α(G) = G.indepNum`, and `λ(v) = indepNeighborsCard G v` is the
independence number of the neighbourhood of `v`.

WOWII [Conjecture 7](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`,
`L_s(G) ≥ max_v λ(v) - 1 + n - 2 α(G)`,
where `L_s(G)` is the maximum number of leaves over all spanning trees of `G`,
`n = |V(G)|`, `α(G) = G.indepNum` is the independence number, and
`λ(v) = indepNeighborsCard G v` is the independence number of the neighbourhood
of `v`.

WOWII status: proved (DeLaVina, Fajtlowicz, Waller (2002)).
